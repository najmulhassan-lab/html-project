        <h1>My Mush World</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Abdullah Fareed Qureshi. I love exploring new things! Today, I’d like to share my mushroom project, inspired by
        the fact that around 90% of mushrooms worldwide go to waste.</p>
        <p>Click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morchella">here </a> to learn about one of the many wonderful species of mushrooms. It’s known as “Guschi” in the Himalayan region —
        delicious and expensive!</p>

        <p>Let me tell you about some of the benefits of mushrooms.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Boosts immune system: Mushrooms contain compounds like beta-glucans that help the immune system function more
            efficiently.</li>
            <li>Promote gut health: Mushrooms are a source of prebiotics that feed beneficial gut bacteria, and some types may even
            contain probiotics that support digestion.</li>
            <li>Protects brain health: Antioxidants and B vitamins in mushrooms support brain function. Regular consumption may also
            lower the risk of mild cognitive impairment.</li>
            <li>Supports heart health: Some mushrooms, like shiitake, can help lower cholesterol levels.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I want to share some imaged of Morchella mushrooms with you.</p>
